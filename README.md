Problem Statement : Many of us have dreams what if I become the founder of a start-up and can lead it to become a big business like Microsoft, or Facebook/Amazon. But again there are many people who cheat people to run their business, probably everyone has heard about cheat-funds. This dataset contains a lot of data and the ‘LICENSE STATUS’ column which depicts whether the person has been able to get a business license or not. Based on the given features you have to predict whether a person will be given a license or not to run his business. The ‘LICENSE STATUS’ contains the following categories:

AAC (license was cancelled during term)
AAI (license was issued)
INQ (license requires inquiry)
REA (license revocation has been appealed)
REV (license was revoked) 
Task : Predict the column “LICENSE STATUS” 


 --- Please note that still a lot of classifiers like SVM,Logistic,XGBoost,Isolated tree... and so many algorithms
are yet to be tested which will be updated here time to time   ---------------------------

--Due to inavailabilty of adequate time, tasks are yet to be completed and updated time-to-time --
